STEP #1:
	Run "rb2js.bat".
		=>  [Compile and create the appropriate JS files,
        based on the user-created Ruby files.]


:: All is done! ::

P.S: With allJsInOne.bat (found in folder "various_batch_files"), a single JS
file is created. However, because all the many JS files must be inserted in a
specific order (and, as of now, it doesnt' work like this via an automatic
manner), it is not used right now.
