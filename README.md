# Ruby on Canvas
Using [Opal](https://github.com/opal/opal) to bring a Ruby-ish HTML5 Canvas API
on the browser.

This was made in 2013. It's still a WIP.

### Demo
Open `/app/rubycanvas.html` in the browser (or visit
[this link](http://337878.playcode.io/) for an online demo).

The source code of the demo is in `/app/demo.rb`.

### Dependencies
`gem install opal`
